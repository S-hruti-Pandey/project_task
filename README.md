# Online Bucket Website

I built the front end part of this website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and used django framework for the backend of the website. I used django's default database for i.e. MySQLite. In this website I also apply filter concept in which user can select any category and only those type of product will be shown to him. All the validations to all the required field have been implemented in this project









## Screens

### 1) Home Screen
This is the home page of the website in which all the products have been displayed. User can also filter the products by choosing specific category.
