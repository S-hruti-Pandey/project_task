# Online Bucket Website

I built the front end part of this website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and used django framework for the backend of the website. I used django's default database for i.e. MySQLite. In this website I also apply filter concept in which user can select any category and only those type of product will be shown to him. All the validations to all the required field have been implemented in this project









## Screens

### 1) Home Screen
This is the home page of the website in which all the products have been displayed. User can also filter the products by choosing specific category.
### 2) Signup Screen
User can register himself by providing his first name, last name, email, password and mobile number. All types of validations have been added in all the fields.
### 3) Login Screen 
In Login Screen, user have to provide his email address and password and the we check whether he is registered in the database or not. If he is registered we navigate him to the landing page of the website other show error message on the login screen.
### 4) Contact Us Screen
When user clicks on contact us screen we basically navigate him to the contact screen in which our mobile number, email, address have been shown. He can also send us message .
